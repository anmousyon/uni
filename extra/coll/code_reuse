CodeHow
    searching reusable code in software repos
    uses free-form queries
    text similarity and relevant APIs
    extended boolean model that combines boolean query with vector space model
    built on elasticsearch and microsoft azure

code retrieval
    query expansion
        relevant APIs
        method body
        method name
    natural language query
        retrieve code based on similarity between expanded query and a code snippet

searching for API usage
    recommends API sample code extracted from repo

applying deep learning
    adapts RNN encoder-decoder
    language model encodes a query and decodes an API sequence
    encoder
        rnn that encodes a sequence into a context vector
    decoder
        rnn that sequentially gens a sentence based on the context vector
    code
        natural language annotation and api sequences
            training instance
                train
                api related query
                        result

code generation
    programming by example (PBE)
        given input/output pairs
        PBE synthesizes a program
    neural programming by example (NPBE)
        given input.output
        NPBE finds relevant tools
            then synthesizes a program
