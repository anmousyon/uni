init vector
    random block used to randomize encryption
    should not be reused
    not considered secret

padding
    multiple of block size

message authentication codes
    ensure integrity and authenticity
    takes secret key and message and returns tag
    needed for most communication
    encrypt-then-MAC
        IPSec
    MAC-then-encrypt
        SSH
    MAC-and-encrypt
        SSL/TLS

block modes
    electronic codebook (ECB)
        not recommended
        each plaintext is related to its encoded block
    cipher block chaining
        most widely used
        changes are cascaded
        XOR with previous ciphertext
        cant be parallelized for encryption
        chain in single bit flip is propogated throughout everything

breaking block ciphers (SSL/TLS)
    BEAST - browser exploit against SSL/TLS

    stems from ability to know the init vector at time of encryption
    this means every packet but the first will have a known init vector

POODLE
    padding oracle on downgraded legacy encryption
    attack against CBC after a forced downgrade
    CBC MAC in SSLv3 doesnt cover padding
        attacker can manipulate padding at will
    SSLv3 mandates padding is (# of bytes) -1 in the final bytes
        and those bytes are ignored
    results in a padding oracle
    attacker can send requests, but not see their plaintext
    attacker forces the final block to be completely padding (message length is a multiple of block size)
        so we know final byte is 15
