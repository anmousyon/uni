            regional
                state gov
    unitary system
        clear hierarcal rel between one central gov and all regional govs
            regional gov is subordinate to central gov
            central gov creates and abolishes regional govs
                legislates for regional govs
            ex. kingdom of norway
                most govs are classified as unitary
    confederal
        regional govs have governing authority and central gov has only the power delegated to it by the regional govs
            central gov is subordinate to the regional governments
            ex. serbia and montenegro (2003-2006)
                no gov currently classified as true confederal
            us was a confederal gov under articles of confederation (1776-1787)

unfunded mandates
    fed laws that require states or local governments to pay the costs of certain federal policy
    ex. americans with disabilities act

federal preemption
    national gov imposes its priorities and prevents states from acting in a particular field through the use of the supremacy clause
    ex.
        oregon death with dignity act (1993)
            fed preemption is not granted by the controlled substances act
        arizona proposition 200
            fed preemption is granted by national b=voting registration act

us v lopez (1995)
    refers to questions of federalism
        how far can the fed gov extend the reaches commerce clause via the necessary and proper clause
    us supreme court (scotus) has been inconsistent in interpreting the reach of the commerce clause
        before new deal
            scotus gave narrow interpretation of the clause
        after new deal and prior to us v lopez
            scotus expanded congress's authority regarding the commerce clause

            yes, any aspect of commerce crossing state lines
        first scotus interpretation of the commerce clause
        defined the word "among" to mean "intermingled with"
    wickard v filburn (1942)
        filburn produced more whaet than the fed gov allowed under agricultural adjustment act of 1938
            filburn was fined by dept of agriculture
        filburn argued the wheat was for himself and did not involve interstate commerce
        wickard argued it involved interstate commerce because had filburn not grown the wheat he would have purchased it from somwhere else
        scotus ruled in favor of wickard
