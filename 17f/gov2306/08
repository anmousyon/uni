### federalism (continued) ###

us v lopez (continued)
    alfonzo lopez carries a concealed weapon to his high school in san antonio
    lopez faced fed charges for violating the gun free school zones act of 1990
        indivs may not knowingly possess a fire arm in a school zone
    lopez was tried in a fed district court
    lopez's lawyer requested the case be dismissed
        because gun free zones act of 1990 was an overreach of fed authority
        state has jurisdiction over public schools
    us gov argued that the act was justified because the business of schools affects interstate commerce
        lopez was convicted
    lopez appealed the case to the fifth circuit court of appeals
        fifth circuit ruled in favor of lopez
        public schools have only a "loose connection" with the commerce clause
    us gov appealed to us supreme court
        us supreme court ruled in favor of lopez
    exceeded the authority of the commerce clause
        act does not regulate commercial activity
        nor requires that possession be linked to interstate commerce
    majority opinion
        federalist #45
    dissenting opinions
        effect on interstate commerce cant be decided by the effect of a single instance/act but the cumulative effect of all possible instances
        guns and violence in schools affect the trade and commerce that the school supports
