mcculloch v maryland (1819)
    created precedent for the questions regarding the relationship of fed and state govs
    first case to referee the dual sovereignty of both entities
    two key questions
        does congress have the power to create a federal bank?
        does maryland have the authority to tax a federal bank?
    facts of case
        first bank of us established in 1791
        second in 1816
            placed in maryland
        maryland passed legislation that levied a tax on any bank established without authority from state of maryland
            meant that maryland taxed second bank of US, and therefore the federal gov
        james mcculloch
            manager of second bank osf us
            refused to pay the taxes
        law suit brought before maryland court of appeals
            ruled in marylands favor
            us constitution doesnt give fed gov power to establish a bank
        case taken up by us supreme court
            chief justice john marshall
        marylands key arguments
            congress cannot create a fed bank
            us constitution emanated from the states
        supreme court ruling
            us constitution emanated from the people, not the state
            maryland cant tax federal gov
            power to tax is power to destroy, and state does not have power to destroy fed gov

necessary and proper clause
    gives congress power to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by the constitution
    if they need to do something to enforce the constitution they can
