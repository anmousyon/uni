!!! test question !!!
q. which of the following is not a question the petition to the scotus presents in bush v gore?
a. whether the florida supreme court will allow florida voters to participate in upcoming presidential elections contests
!!! test question !!!

barriers
    in many texas cities, council members are elected at-large; no individual districts
        members of a district cast votes
            top 5 with the most votes become city council members
        whoever is not in the majority has little chance of electing someone who represents their interests
        this is a barrier to rep
            single-member districts can remedy this barrier to voting
    other tactics sometimes in play
        reduced number of polling places
        broken voting machines
        misleading info provided to voters
        voter intimidation

dividing pop
    all states are divided into districts
        three types
            us congressional
            state congressional
            state senate
        based off census
            every 10 years
    reapportionment
        determines how many congressional seats each state will receive
        in us congress
            435 seats in house
