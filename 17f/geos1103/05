            silstone
            mudstone
chemical
    carbonates
        primarily composed of calcite, """, """
        may be chemical precipitates

energy of depositional env
    rule
        large rocks came from very high energy environments

examples
    """
    breccia
        large particles
        sharp edges
    sandstone
        small grains
        possibly banded
        different colors
            comes from different cements
    shale
        different colors
        clay sized particles
    fossiliferous sandstone
        has fossil in it
    crinoidal coquina
        crinoid is a small animal whose skeleton turns into a bunch of little rings
    chalk
        white
        fine particles

sedimentary rocks
    selicious
        shale
            very thin layers
                ~1 mm thick
            slightly abrasive feel
        sandstone
            very fine particles
            sandpaper texture
        arkose
            mineral composition
                at least 25% k feldspar
        breccia
            large particles
            sharp edges
        congolmerate
            smoother than breccia
            sharp edges
        chert
            microcrystalline
                tiny quartz crystal
            precipitates from solution
            smooth
            very hard
            sharp edges
            different colors
    carbonate
        limestone
            from remains of organisms
                might have fossils/shells
            reacts to acid test
        dolostone
            doesnt react to normal acid test
            powdered form reacts to acid test
        chalk
            very strong reaction to acid test
            made of microscopic shells
        coquina
            made of broken shells
            very strong reaction to acid test
        travertine
            same composition as calcite
                different crystal system
            looks like scoria
            reacts to acid test
        lignite (coal)
            doesnt react to acid test
                is made of carbon
            remains of terrestrial plants
            looks like charcoal briquette
            very light
            70% carbon
