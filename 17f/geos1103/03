### igneous rocks ###

vary greatly
    some contain large mineral grains
    others contain grains so small they can barely be seen under a high power microscope
    very different colors

formation
    all formed through cooling of liquid magma
    intrusive
        form when magma cools within existing rocks in earth's crust
        other rocks acts as insulators, cools very slowly
    extrusive
        form when magma cools on earth's surface, where they have been "extruded"
        exposed to open air, cools very quickly

texture
    phaneritic
        coarse grain
    aphanitic
        fine grain
    glassy
        cooled extremely fast
        ex. obsidian
    vesicular
        vesicles
            trapped gas bubbles form in cooled magma
    scoria
        more smaller vesicles

high abundance of hornblende leads to intermiediate column
    then classify based on grain

classification
    1. identify the texture
    2. determine if rock is felsic (light) , intermediate (medium), mafic (dark), or ultra-mafic
    3. classify the rock using chart
        use textural terms to clarify

1. granite
    coarse grain
    phaneritic
    light colored
    intrusive
2. rhyolite
    fine grained
    aphanitic
    red brick colored
    extrusive
3. diorite
    coarse grained
    phaneritic
    black and white
    intrusive
4. andesite
    fine grained
    aphanitic
    extrusive
5. gabbro
    coarse grained
    phaneritic
    intrusive
6. basalt
    fine grained
    aphanitic
    extrusive
7. peridotite
    coarse grained
    phaneritic
    intrusive
    also called olivine when a mineral
8. vesicular basalt
9. scoria
    more vesicular than scoria
    always mafic
10. pumice
    more vesicular than scoria
    very light
11. obsidian
    glassy
12. tuff
    commonly confused with pumice
    made of individual particles
