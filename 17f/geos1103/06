### metamorphic rocks ###

changes due to
    chemical composition
    change in temp, pressure
        heat
            burial or nearby igneous intrusion
        low grade
            250 < x < 500
            slaty cleavage
        high grade
            x > 500
    presence or ansence of fluids

once melting starts, metamorphism is over

mineral assembly change
    minerals can chage from one to another
    each assemblage is characteristic of a given rock composition

metamorphic environments
    contact
        local
    burial, plate interactions
        regional

facies
    three trajectories
        high temp, low pressure
            conteact
        med temp, med pressure
            regional
        low temp, high pressure
            regional
            subduction zones

rocks
    shale and mudstone
        slate
            low grade
        phyllite
            intermediate grade
            sheen on surface
                larger mica grains
        schist
            high grade
            coarse grain
        gneiss
            high grade
            coarse grain
    limestone
        marble
            coarse
            pure marble is snow white
    sandstone
        quartzite

textures
    foliation
        alignment of sheet-like materials
        layering
    non-foliated / granular

samples
    slate
        foliated
        layers/laminations
        dull
    phyllite
        foliated
        subtle sheen
    schist
        foliated
        shiny
        might have tiny garnets
    gneiss
        foliated
        banded
        looks like diorite from the side
    quartzite
        looks similar to sandstone
            grains are filled through crystallization
    marble
        bright white / salmon
        mineral is calcite
            responds to acid test
    anthracite coal
        95% carbon
        looks similar to obsidian
            feels lighter than obsidian
