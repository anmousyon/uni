geologic column
    last 600m years
    era name based on fossils found in them,

symbols and colors used to represent rock types

constructing a geologic column from geologic cross section
    disconformity
        symbol is wiggly line
            if there is an overlying unit, need to include unconformity between them
        erosional
            cross section diplays cuts in the rock
        angular
            cross section shows possibly folded rocks

correlation of geologic columnms
    finding the same order of layers in different localities

absolute time
    radiometric dating

terms
    formation
        body of rock with distinct composition
        doesnt have to be homogeneous
    contact
        boundary between two formations or rock types
    bedding planes
        parrallel top & bottom usually
    folds
        geometrick form from originally horizontal strata
    outcrop pattern
        map view of a particular structure
    attitude
        a tilted body of rock that tilts into a body of water
        strike
            line of intersection between horizontal plane & structural surface
        dip
            measured normal to strike
            downward deflection of surface relative to horizontal
    geo map
        map show geo features
    geo cross section
    3d block diagram

anticline and sincline
    anticline = arch
    anticline
        arch
        limbs dip away from fold axis
    syncline
        bowl
        limbs reach toward fold axis
    axis
        plane out top
    surface
        plane out side

fold anatomy
    be able to sketch and lable an anticline and sincline together

map synbols
    horizontal bed
        circle with cross
    strike and dip
        incline straight down
        overturned
            upside down J
    folds
        anticline
            arrows away from axis
        syncline
            arrows toward the axis
        plunging fold
            use arrow for fold axis
            fold is not parrallel to the surface
    contacts
        definite
            solid line
        approximate
            dashed line
    faults
        D above
        U below
        thrust fault
            jagged line

structural dome
    will see anticline or syncline on sides of structure
