fault types
    normal
        hanging wall has moved down relative to footwall
        divergent boundary
    reverse
        hanging wall has moved up relative to the footwall
        convergent boundary
    thrust
        reverse fault that dips less than 45 degrees
    strike-slip
        relative displacement along fault plane in horizontal direction
        parallel to each other
        transform boundary
    horst
        two normal faults on either side of central block
        central block is footwall
    graben
        two normal faults on either side of central block
        central block is hanging wall
    
earthquakes
    focus
        where movement begins on fault plane
    epicenter
