### erosion ###

weathering
    series of processes to break down rock
    physical
    chemical
    biological

exfoliation
    split into sheets parallel to the mountain face

abrasion
    sedimentary rocks collide

ventifacts
    flat surface caused by abrasion

freeze thaw process
    ice wdging
    talus
        slope created by gravity and ice wedging

hydraulic action
    Force of breaking waves forces water into cracks and fractures
    air trapped at the bottom of these opening
        compressed against the rock and weakens it

salt weathering
    Evaporation of salt water causes crystallization of and growth of salts, which breaks the rocks apart

Solar Weathering (insolation weathering)
    differential eating and cooling of rock caused by the sun
        causes rocks to break apart

chemical weathering
    Hydrolysis, Oxidation, and Dissolution

weathering v erosion
    in place = weathering
    moving = erosion

erosion
    fluvial
        particles of sediment moved by flowing water in a channel
    mass wasting
        ediment moved by gravity
    eolian
    sediment moved by wind

### sedimentary rocks ###

75% of land surface

lithification
    cementation and compaction

### crust deformations ###

directed stress
    deformation

differential stress
    tensional
    compressive
    shear

strain
    change in shape and or volume of a rock caused by stress
    three stages
        elastic deformation
            fully reversible
        ductile deformation
            irreversible
        fracture
            brittle deformation

strike
     compass orientation of a line formed by the intersection of an imaginary horizontal plane with the inclined bedding plane

dip
    angle between the imaginary horizontal plane and the inclined rock layer

brittle deformation
    joints
        cracks without displacement
    faults
        fracture planes along displacement
    footwall
        rocks below fault plane
    hanging wall
        rocks above fault plane
    dip-slip
        movement of rock along dip of fault plane
        types
            normal fault
                hanging wall moves downward
            reverse fault
