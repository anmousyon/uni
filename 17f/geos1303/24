### deserts ###

covers about 1/3 of land area

boundary of desert changes

basics
    land area that gets < 25 cm of precipitation per year
    sparse vegetation
        unable to support significant animal populations
    temperature extremes
        too little humidity to block suns rays or retain heat

desert cycles
    orbital parameters
    amount of insolation
    monsoon shift

atmosphere moisture circulation
    polar cells
        sinking at poles
        rising at 60 degreees latitude
    ferrel cells
        sinking at 30
        rising at 60
    hadley cells
        rising at equator
        sinking at 30

coriolis effect
    deflection of wind and water circulation on planet surface

orographic effect
    upliftment of land causes air to rise and cool
    causes lots of rain on the side of mountain that gets the wind

factors
    distance atmospheric moisture is transported
    dry, cold air transported over polar areas
    cold ocean current adjacent to a tropical coast
    humans' poor management of land
        deforestation
        overfarming

wind
    grains accumulate around an obstacle like vegetation
    formations
        ripple
            cm scale features
        dunes
            meter scale features
    moves dunes slowly
        erosion by saltation
        deoposition and slumping
        stoss slope
            windward slope
        slip face
            lee slope
        angle of 30-34 degrees
    silt carried in suspension
        produces well sorted sediments
        loess
            deposits of windblow silt
            exposed by advances and retreats of continental glaciers
        eolian deposits
            left by continental glaciers
    desert pavement
        extensive lag deposit of coarse sediment left after fines grains blow away
    yardang
        rock outcrop sculpted by sand abrasion
    desert varnish
        dark surface coating of iron and manganese oxides
        forms very slowly by bacterial acitivy, dust, and water
        petroglyphs are sometimes made in this

sand dunes
    formation
        abundant loose sediment
            usually sand
        sufficient energy to move
            usually wind
        obstacle to trap sand
            often a bush or rock
        dry climate
    types
        crescentic
            barchan
                formation
                    strong wind in one direction
                    small amounts of sand
                    limited vegetation
                looks
                    crescent moon
                    horns point downwind
            transverse
                formation
                    weak wind in one direction
                    large amounts of sand perpendicular to wind
                    limited vegetation
                looks
                    long
                    wavy
                    linear
        parabolic
            formation
                may be anchored by vegetation
                often start as semicircular blowouts that elongate
            looks
                crescent moon
                horns point upwind
        longitudinal
            formation
                strong, steadywinds flowing from two directions
            looks
                two slip faces aligned with wind
                large, straight or sinous ridge
        star
            formation
                multidirectional winds
            looks
                pyramid
                3 or more arms radiate from peak
                grows tall instead of moving
        sand seas
            looks
                large regions of windblown sand
                numerous, very large dunes
                sand covers >20% of land area
                like a very large area of transverse dunes
    
water
    ephemeral streams
        flow only after heavy raines
    flash floods
        very common
