earths largest and most active seismicity occurs at convergent boundaries?

the p wave is the fastest kind of seismic wave
    other kinds: love

what causes shaking during an earthquake?
    both the abrupt release of strain that has slowly accumulated rock, and seismic waves, which radiate through the earths crust

tornadoes are not a principle eqrthquake hazard
    tornadoes

what causes wave refraction?
    changes in wave velocity due to rock density differences

the interiors of tectonic plates are, for the most part, prone to the same high numbers of quakes that occur at plate boundaries
    false
    example: pacific rim

point where slippage first occurs is called the earthquake focus, and the epicenter is the geo spot on the earths surface that is above the focus

describe how sediment liquefaction occurs and its effets
    earthquake causes water table to rise up and saturate sediment
    breaks the cohesiveness between the sediment which causes sinking

solifluction
    upper layer of permafrost melts and moves above still frozen lower layer

what indicaates that faulting and deformation have occured
    broken, displaced, and folded layers

which types of wave causes the strongest vibrations and worst damage
    surface wave

calculations based on relative dating have shown that earth formed approximately 4.6 bya
    false
    radiometric dating is used
        carbon
        uranium

what techniques are used to determine when earth was formed
    moon rocks
    old rocks
    lead isotopes created by radioacive decay

principle of inclusion and principle of lateral continuity
    inclusion: outside rock is always younger than inside rock
    lateral continuity: layers will spread forever until obstructed

example of radioisotope
    uranium
    thorium
    potassium

presence of sedimentary rocks
    deposition happened

vestigial structures
    relics of body parts that were used by ancestral forms

geo time units from shortest to longest
    epochs, periods, eras, eons

know the progression of the eras and the main things that happened

proterozoic era
    single cellular to multicellular
    first mountains
    first super continient
        rodinia

oldest to most recent
    cenozoic, mesozoic, paleozoic

jurrasic period
    dinos were dominant animal form on land

glacial erosion
    caused by plucking and abrasion

moraines
    glacial moraine
        assorted debris left where a glacier used to be
    types
        lateral
            rock fall on side of glacier
        medial
            two glaciers meet meet at a point
        ground
            unconsolidated sediment beneath glacial ice
            deposition at bottom
        end
            end of glacial deposits
        terminal
            farthest advance glacier has ever reached
        
quarternary period is the most recent period of geo time

glacial erratics
    blocks of bedrock with a foreign lithology that have been directly deopsited by melting ice
    random boulders of rock, that are different than the region, dropped by glacier

orbital params of earth that affect level of insolation recieved at aphelion (point in orbit, farthest from sun) and at perihelion (closest)
    eccentricity
        level of elasticity of orbit

interstadials    
    minor episode of warming

stadials
    minor episodes of cooling

glaciation
    major cooling

interglaciation
    major warming

MIS 5
    last interglacial period

MIS 2
    last glacial period

microscopic plankton foraminifera reveal a history of global ice volume that contracticts uce core records from greenland and antarctica
    false

how long ago was the last interglacial occur
    75-130 kya

four factors of mass wasting classification
    nature of moving mass
    type of material
    surrounding environments
    rate of movement

slides can develop on
    bedding plane
    clay layer
    buried erosional surface
    joint surface

creep
    common indicators
        curved tree trunks
        tilted power poles
        bent fences
        bent walls
    very slow

swamps
    deforestation
    heavy rains
    earthquakes
    overly steepened hills

mud flows travel faster and farther than debris flows

angle of repose
    slope beyond which an uconsolidated mass will spontanteously fall

mass wasting
    factors
        water
        gravity
        oversteepening
            angle of the slope beyond angle of repose
        trigger
            vibrations

land use planning
    examples
        analyzing hillside geology prebuild
        not building on or below unstable slopes
        avoiding actions that may cause slope failure
        not removing vegetation that holds regolith in place
