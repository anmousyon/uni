### planet formation ###

asteroids
    metallic

comets
    icy (water ice and frozen liquids, gases)
    coma (tail)
        white
            sunlight reflection
        blue
            gas contained inside

dwarf planets
    smaller than a planet
    hasnt cleared orbital belt
    examples
        haumea, makemake, pluto
            kupier belt
            pluto and charon considered a "double-dwarf"
        eris
            scattered disk region
                overlaps kupier belt
            slightly larger than pluto
        ceres
            large asteroid in asteroid belt
                only dwarf planet there

planet
    orbits the sun
    sufficient mass to be spherical
    cleared all other objects from the neighborhood of its orbit

hydrosphere formation
    two hypothesis
        late delivery hypothesis
            from ice-covered comets that originated farther out in cooler, gaseous part of solar system
            evidence
                hale-bopp comet
                    contains substantial amount of heavy water
            conclusion
                unlikely to be true
        initially wet earth hypothesis
            relatively "wet" planetary embryos
            planetismals condensed near asteroid belt in proximity to jupiter causing erratic orbits
            crashed into earth
            evidence
                total 1.8 billion cubic km of water
                planet had more water at start than today

### plate tectonics ###

theory
    crust is seperated into massive plates
    plates move very slowly

ocean topography
    highly variable
        same as on continents
    ages
        newest
            oceanic ridge
        oldest
            oceanic basin
    new rock comes out of the oceanic ridge
    old rock is subducted along oceanic basin

continental topography
    mountain chains
        form along continental boundaries

layers
    core
        inner
            solid
            1220 km
        outer
            liquid
            2260 km
    mantle
        rock capable of flow
        2900 km
    crust
        ~5km

iron catastrophe
    at 1538C, Fe melted
        dense liquid Fe sank to form core
    junction between hadean and archean eons is defined by formation of crust

chemical differentiation
    process created earth's internal structure
    crust
        lightweight, low-melting-temp elements
        continental crust
            relatively enriched rock
            "floats" on denser mantle
        oceanic crust
            rock is dense
            Fe and Mg-rich, formed on seafloor
    mantle
        plasticity; lower mantle is hotter
            convection plumes
        lower lithosphere rests on asthenosphere
    core
        dense, high-melting-temp elements
        about 2900km below surface
        creates earth's magnetic field
            inner is solid Fe
            outer core is molten

tectonic theory
    plates move in response to forces in mantle
    plate boundaries are locations of great geological change

spreading centers
    magma erupts from mantle
    new rock added to plate margin

subduction zones
    plates are recycles into mantle
    characterized by deep-sea trenches
    denser plate subducts beneath less dense plate

new oceanic crust
    two or more plates pull apart
    molten material rises through rift zone (spreading centers)
    newest magma on either side of rift
    like conveyor belt
        newer crust travels from center on each side
    oceanics crust records reversed and normal polarity episodes

paleomagnetism
    confirms seafloor-spreading hypothesis
        geomagnetic field switches from reversed to normal polarity on irregular basis

ring of fire
    most seismically and volcanically active zone in the world

plate boundaries
    divergent
        new litho forms as plates pull apart
    transform
        plates grind past each other, no change in litho
    convergent
        one plate dives beneath another or two plates collide without either subducting
        ocean-continent
            plate of oceanic crust subducted under continental plate
        ocean-ocean
            older, denser plate usually subducts
            site of island arc formation
                indonesia
        continent-continent
            orogenesis
                mountain formation
                ex
                    himalayas

contracting earth hypothesis (NOT VALID)
    hot interior that is losing its heat
    mountain belts the result of contraction
        like wrinkles in drying apple
    continents and oceans fixed in place
    tension
        inner region of earth underwent rapid cooling and contracting
    compression
        outer region

wegner hypothesis
    matching geo and fossil features
        similar fossils on different continents
        matching mountain ranges between continents
            similar age
            similar shape
    fit of the continents
    ancient climates
        glacial deposits
            glacial striations
        orientation matches between continents
    not originally universally accepted
        he had no mechanism for continents to move

81% of earthquakes occur in the ring of fire

alpide belt extends from java to himalayas

plate movement powers the rock cycle
    giant recycling machine
