pangea
    supercontinent
    basis of alfred wagner's continental drift theory

seafloor spreading
    from captain herry hess
    explains continental drift
    hess theorized that earth's crust tears open and molten rock rises from below to form new crust

hotspots
    explains chains of volcanic islands
    older as you move from the source

rock
    solid aggregation of minerals
    three families
        igneous
            magma cooling
        sedimentary
            other rock types breaking and coming together
        metamorphic
            sedimentary exposed to high pressurea and temperature

principle of uniformitarianism
    earth is very old
    natural process have been uniform throughout history

formation of the earth
    inner planet
        silicate crusts and mantles
        iron-nickel cores
        thin or no atmosphere
    outer planet
        mostly hydrogen and helium gas, and ices
        small rock and iron cores

nuclear fusion
    lighter elements fuse together to form heavier elements

red giant
    star that is running out of hydrogen
    star eventually explodes in a nova

process
    contracting nebular cloud of dust and gas
    nebula contracts into rotating disk
    dust accretes into larger masses
    gas rich planets accrete in outer disk
    rocky planetesimals form in inner disk

our solar system
    8 planets
    5 dwarf planets
        small solar system bodies
    240 known moons
    countless particles and interplanetary space
    all objects in solar system originated at the same time, from the same source

planets
    early planets grew large enough that their gravities affected each other
        especially in inner solar system

leftovers
    asteroids
        rocky planetismals that form and orbiting belt between mars and jupiter
        called a meteor if it comes into our atmosphere
    comets
        mixtures of ice and rock that originate beyond the kuiper belt
        but some have orbits that cross into inner solar system where they can collide with planets
