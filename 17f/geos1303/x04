drainage system
    fed by surface runoff
    radial drainage
        runoff flows away from dome or hilltop in all directions

water vapor transportation
    convection moves it the most

    runoff

water flow movement
    regular/uniform path
        laminar
        faster

        move in all random/different directions
    
freshwater
    95% supplied by water wells

clay
    high porosity but low permeability

water table
    boundary that separates saturated zones from unsaturated zones

permeability
    ability for water to flow inside the rock

porosity
    volume of pores / total volume of rock

spring
    needs interaction between water table and surface

karst formation
    dissolution of carbon dioxide into groundwater
    product: carbonic acid

aquifer
    body of groundwater with sufficient porosity and permeability to supply water
    aquitard
        impermeable layer in aquifer that prevents the flow of groundwater
    confined aquifer
        aquifer that is below an aquitard
    consolidated
        with cemented or compacted grains
    increase premeability
        aquifer fracturing

deserts
    two largest deserts
        covered in ice and snow
        recieve little annual precipitation
            less than 25cm per year
    formation
        rain shadows
        close to cold seawater
        dry, cold air over polar regions
        far from moisture
    midlatitude deserts
        wide range if annual temperatures
        between 40-50N/S latitude

global atmospheric circulation
    primary fector determining variations in rainfall
    atmospheric cells
        hadley
            rise at equator
            sink near 30 deg
        polar
            air rises at 60 deg
            sinks near poles
        ferrel
            sink near 30
            rise near polar

wave
    zones
        breaker zone
        surf zone
        breach
    size
        wind velocity
        fetch
        duration of time

reefs
    types
        fringing
            attached to land area
            extend into water
        patch
            multiple small patches
        barrier
            bariier island 
        atoll
            collapse of volcanic mountain

emergent coasts
    beach ridges

fundamental sources of energy
    earths interior
    nuclear fusion in sun
    nuclear fission reactions
    pull of gravity
    fossil fuels
        more than 50% of petroleum deposits in Mesozoic rocks

hydrocarbon system
    highly rich, organic source rock
    ideal pressure-temperature-time envs
        90-160 degrees C
    high porosity, high permeability reservoir rocks
    traps that allow accumulation of migrating hydrocarbons

ethanol
    not proven as a gasoline replacement
    would take food resources away
    burns less efficiently than petroleum

reservoir rock
    contains oil, gas, and water

anthractie coal
    95% - very pure

greenhouse
    four principal gases
        ozone
        methane
        carbon dioxide
        CFC
        water vapor
        nitrous oxide

    CO2
        most adundant after water vapor
        lasts a long time
            can stay for centuries compared to water vapor staying days to weeks
