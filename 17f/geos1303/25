wave base
    1/2 wavelength
    water below this not moved by wind waves

wave -> shore
    friction slows it
    moves faster near surface
        causes cresting
    wave oversteepens and crashes on beach

wave refraction and wave-generated currents
    waves approach at an angle
    refracts waves to be parallel to bottom contours
    irregular shoreline has variable water depth
    as waves drag on bottom, they bend
    wave refraction
        wave attack is concentrated against headlands
        wave attack
        is dissipated in embayments
        eventually straightens an irregular shore
    wave-generated currents
        breakers and bores cause net movement toward shoreline
        raises sea level along coast, creating "setup"
        causes current along seabed

longshore currents
    sediment is transported along the shore
        oblique waves push sediment sideways up the beach
        gravity pulls sediment down the slope
        causes a zig-zag pattern that moves sediment in one direction

rip currents
    water piles up on the beach and must return seaward
        develops perpindicular to beach
        often headstrong; dangerous
    dissipates out into surf zone

tides
    regular and predictable oscillations in sea surface
    rises and falls twice daily
        high tide
            maximal tidal flooding
        low tide
            maximal tidal withdrawal
        tidal reach
            range between high and low tides
        tidal zone
            between high and low tide
    caused by
        gravitational pull of moon
            sublunar bulge follows the moons orbit
            bulge makes high tides
            between bulges is low tides
        lunar and solar tial effects interact
            spring tides
                psoitive alignment
                lined up
            neap tides
                negative alignment
                at 90 degree angle
    magnitude and timing factors
        relative orientation of sun and moon
        orbital props of moon
        basin geometry
        axial tilt
        air pressure

hurricanes and tropical storms
    hurricanes
        formation
            develop in summer and late fall
            form over warm, tropical oceans
                cyclonic low-pressure "disturbances" pull air inwards
                air rises, cools, and condenses, releasing latent heat
                heat buoys air, creates low pressure, pulls in more air
                over time, storm gains size and stength
        structure
            spiral arms (rain bands)
                mark rotating air pulled inwards
            converging winds accelerate, rise up, and spill out
            eye
                situated in storm center
                cold, cry air is pulled down into eye
                eye wall is a vertical cylinder of high-velocity wind
        size
            100 -> 1500 km
        strength
            117 -> 190 km/h
        landfall
            loses strength
            lack of warm, moist air
        name
            typhoon in western pacific ocean
            cyclone in northern indian ocean
        intensity
            categories 1-5
            separated by stength

sea levels
    rising due to global warming
    .75 -> 1.8 meters by 2100
        depends on rate of greenhouse gas release

coastal landforms
    types
        broad, sandy beaches
            narrow barrier islands
                fragile and constantly changing
                shift their position when overrun by storm surges
            rock shorelines
                retreat slowly
                bedrock rises out of sea
                    wave action often powerful
                    concentrated wave energy erodes the rock
        lush, swampy wetlands
        drowned river valleys
        tidal marshes
    coastal variability
        passive margin
            broad, low lying coastal plains typical
        active margin
            uplifted, rocky coasts dominate
