### groundwater ###

95% of unfrozen surface water is groundwater

vegetation linked to groundwater recharge

location
    pores
        fractures, joints, and other spaces below soil regoloth
        1mm or less usually
    porosity
        percentage of void space in a regolith or underlying rock
        ratio: volume of voids / total volume
        material
            sediments
                silt and clay: 30-60%
                well-sorted sand and gravel 25-50%
                mixed sand and gravel: 20-25%
            rocks
                shale: 0-10%
                ...

water table
    top most boundary of groundwater
    mimics topography of ground surface above
    discharge
        water leaving system
    recharge
        water entering system
    artificial recharge
        injection wells
        infiltration ponds

infiltration
    precipitation collected in fractures in rocks

permeability
    ability of water to flow through a porous material

aquifer
    body of ground water with sufficient porosity and permeability to provide useful wauntities of water for wells or springs
    limestone degrades from CO2 and water reacting and forming carbonic acid
    unconfined
        water flows in all directions
    confined
        water confined by unpermeable layer
        water flows in a certain direction
    artesian
        water escapes to surface driven by hydraulic gradient of the water table
        similar to how a water tower works

hydraulic gradient
    (h2-h1) / L

darcy's law
    v = (K * (h2 - h1)) / L
    k = coefficient of permeability

high plains aquifer
    both withdrawal and recharge streams used in arid region
    water levels declined
    feeds approximately 170k wells

subsidence
    compaction of pore space
    causes surface elecation decrease and open fissure formation

cone of depression
    withdraws water faster than recharge rate
    can be used to create a water treatment facility

saltwater intrusion
    population increases near coast puts high demand on ground water
    moves transition zone up toward well
    leads to saltwater intrusion and deterioration of water quality
    sea level rising from global warming acclereates this process

sewage waste
    usually contaminates unconfined aquifers

groundwater remediation
    air sparging
        injecting gas into saturated zone
        mobalizes contaminants into gaseous state if possible
    directional wells
    recirculation wells
        circulating contaminated water up to surface to remove contaminants
    aquifer fracturing
        improve access to pollutants to remove them
    injection wells
        inject unharmful chemical additives that break down harmful chemicals
    permeable reactive barriers
        barrier that removes contaminants but lets water through
    bioremediation
        ue microbes or plant tissues to neutralize contaminants
    phytoremediation
        utilizes plants to absorb metal into roots and remove contaminants
    thermal or electrical treatments
        inject 
        energy (heat, electricity, etc) to breakdown contaminants

karst topographhy
    caves
    sinkholes

hydrothermal activity
    geiser
        water goes very deep
            in contact with magma
        cold water at surface
    fumarole
        oxidation of hydrogen sulfide
        creates brilliant green and yellow colors
    hot spring

caves
    speleothems
        groundwater entering a cave degasses CO2
        calcium carbonate precipitated on interior surfaces
        stalactites
            hang down
        stalagmites
            point up
        columns
            where they meet

groundwater velocity
    measure transit time of a tracer chemical
