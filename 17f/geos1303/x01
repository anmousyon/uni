### test review ###

sedimentary 
    formed by compacted or cemented sediment
    erosion

metamorphic
    chemical and physical change due to high pressure and temperature
    not melting

igneous
    melting and forming new rock

rock cycle
    weathering -> erosion -> deposition

primary constituent of crust
    igneous

convection moves the plates

captain harry hess
    proposed the seafloor spreading hypothesis

alfred wagner (early 1900s)
    proposed continental drift hypothesis
    evidence
        location of similar fossils
        continuous geographic features
        coastal lines fit like jigsaw puzzle
        similar glacial striations
    non-acceptance reasons
        no mechanism for plates to move

pangea
    mass of land existed before continents drifted
    split into laurasia and gondwana land in jurassic period

tectonics
    causes plates to collide and become recycled into earths interior while other plates seperate and let out new molten rock
    reasons for continental drift
        seafloor spreading
        convection currents
        subduction from gravity
        fall along slope from seafloor ridges

hotspot theory
    chains of islands that get older as you move away from the source

geologic systems are the product of interactions among the spheres
    geosphere/lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere
        geosphere and lithosphere are the same

principle of uniformitarianism
    the present is the key to the past

four terrestrial planets
    mercury, venus, earth, mars
    rich in iron, magnesium, silicate, oxygen

age of universe is 14 billion years old

age of planet/solar system is 4.6 billion years

five elements at start of universe
    hydrogen, helium, beryllium, boron, and lithium
    new heavier elements caused by nuclear fusion
    92 current elements

hadean era
    earths surface was a sea of molten rock

archean eon
    start of the crust
    3.8 billion years ago

venus is hotter than mercury
    atmosphere is 96.5% co2
        traps heat in the atmosphere
    max temp is 477C

satrun
    rings
        made of rock and ice
    saturn is the only planet less dense than water

comets cant provide earth with enough water
    comets are found to be 'heavy water' rich with deuterium but earths oceans are not

.3% of earths water is in lakes and rivers

iron catastrophe
    earths temperature went beyond the melting point of iron

earths thickest layer
    mantle
    2900km

earths thinnest layer
    crust
    continental thickness
        20-80km
    oceanic crust
        5-10km

earths layers from surface to interior
    physical: lithosphere, asthenosphere, lower mantle, outer core, inner core
    chemical: crust, mantle, core

iron and nickel in core
    solid because of very high pressure
    reach 5400C

sun
    can reach 16 million C
    8 minutes for light to reach earth

two most abundant elements on earth
    iron and oxygen

earths magnetic field caused by liquid outer core rubbing against solid inner core

subduction zones
    where plates submerge into mantle

pyrite is commonly called "fools gold"

4 naked elements
    gold, silver, lead, graphite

common rock forming minerals
    6 out of 7 are silicate
    calcite only non-silicate

only type of atom without neutrons
    hydrogen

galena
    known for being very dense
    lead extracted from it

largest, most complex mineral group
    silicates

smallest to largest component on earth
    atoms, minerals, rocks, lithospheric plates, earth's crust

basalt forms the bedrock of every ocean, millions of square km

granite is enriched in silicon and oxygen but depleted in iron and magnesium

decompression melting
    less pressure in area which decreases melting point
    occurs between lithosphere and asthenosphere

igneous rock formation
    tectonic settings
        hotspot
        subduction zone
        spreading zone
    boundaries
        convergent
        divergent
        transform

igneous evolution
    prcoess that igneous rocks go through to form the different types of rock on earth today
