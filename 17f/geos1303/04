### minerals ###

inorganic chemical compounds consisting of combinations of atoms of one or more element

every mineral has a definite chemical comp and regular internal atomic structure

~4k minerals are currently known

all rocks consist of minerals
    rock is a solid aggregate of minerals

rock forming minerals
    feldspars
        most abundant in earths crust
        none in mantle
        chemical weathering
            forms clay minerals
    quartz
    olivine
    pyroxene
    plagioclase and othoclase
    biotite
    calcite
        only non silicate
    aphibole

7 major classes
    halides
    oxides
        magnetite
    silicates
        olivine, pyroxene, amphibole
        all rock forming minerals but calcite
    native elements
        gold
    carbonates
    sulfides
        galena and pyrite
    sulfates
        
iron and oxygen are most commin in whole earth

silicon and oxygen are most common in crust

properties
    color
    luster
    streak
    hardness
    cleavage
        where minerals break easiest due to bond structure
        fracture
            breakage not along cleavage plane
    external crystal form
    density

ionic bonds
    imbalance of porotons and neutrons creates charged ions

covalent bonds
    uncharged atoms bond by sharing electrons in their outermost orbits
    ex
        water

metallic bonds
    bonding between atoms withing metals
