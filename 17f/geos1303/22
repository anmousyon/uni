watershed order
    highest order basin in watershed boundary

drainage patterns
    dendritic
        treelike branches
        underlying rock is a uniform material
        lack of joins and fractures
        soft rocks
    radial
        runoff flows away from dome or hilltop in all directions
    trellis
        bedrock exerts strong control over streams because of the structure of the underlying geology
    rectangular
        parallel joins and fractures on ground
        gridlike pattern

discharge
    Q = AV
    Q = stream discharge
    A = cross-sectional area
    V = flow velocity
    volume/time = cfs (cubic feet per second) or m^3/s
    varies seasonally due to precipitation and runoff

    turblulent
        irregular pattern
    laminar
        straight stream
        uniform direction

eddie
    contain flow components not directed downstream
    ten to produce locally chaotic water movement

amount of water in a river's watershed increases downstream because of the addition of tributaries

channel characteristics
    gradient
        decreases as it moves farther from source
    discharge
        velocity is not uniform in all areas
        higher friction in wider, shallower streams
        in straight channels, highest velocity is in the center, at the surface
        outside curve is preferentially scoured and deepened
        thalweg
            marks the natural direction of flow

            move by
                traction
                     hit by other materials   
                     rolling
                saltation
                    pulled up and then set back down by water
                    jumping
        dissolved load
            dissolved compounds such as Ca, Cl, Na, Mg, K
        
sediment erosion
    hjulstrom diagram
        plots the relationship between water, velocity, and sediment size
        velocity vs diameter
        high velocity and low diameter = erosion
        low velocity and high diameter = deposition
        med velocity and med diameter = transportation

stream channel types
    straight
        rare
        usually a short segment of meandering channels
    meandering
        most common characteristics of a stream that is free to roam across a valley floor
        looping curves
            along portion of the profile with a low gradient
            where streams travel over a broad floodplain
            when substrates are soft and easily eroded
        evolving
            change from variation in thalweg position
            max velocity swings back and forth across flow
            oxbow lake
                meander bend will eventually cut across a neck
    braided
        when a stream contains more sediment than it can readily transport
        assumulates in channel and constructs bars and islands that split the water into multiple channels
        in areas with high slope
            moutainous areas

flooding
    natural process in healthy streams
    when discharge rate is higher that stream can hold in its banks

floodplains
    flat areas adjacent to stream channels
    composed of sediments deposited during floods
    features
        natural levees
        former point bars
        wetlands
        oxbow lakes
    when discharge is lowered, a layer of sediment is deposited across the floodplain

graded profile
    streams are generally
        steeper in their upper reaches
        gentle in lower extents
    gently concave profile with a flattened lower end
    near headwater source
        steep
        low discharge
        coarse sediments
        straight and rocky channel
    near mouth
        flatter
        higher discharge
        smaller grain-sizes
        broad meander belts

headward erosion
    high velocity flow at source
    stream extends upward into its source
    stream piracy
        if it breaches a drainage divide
            it intersects another channel and captures its flow

fluvial landscape
    tectonic uplift setting
        waterfalls
        v-shaped valleys
        gorges
    mass wasting and undercutting of slopes
        widens valleys
        meandering more pronounced

graded stream
    state of dynamic equilibrium between erosion and deposition
    always defined over a specific segment of channel

base level
    lowest point to which a stream can erode
    ultimate base level
        sea level
    local base level
        lake
            lowering base level increases erosion
        ledge of resistant rock
            can create waterfall at edge of resistant rock

incised channels and terraces
    alluvial terraces
        graded stream inceises its floodplain
    can be result of
        decreased sediment load
        lowered base level
        increased gradient due to tectonic uplift
    terraces
        former floodplain deposists that are exposed when a stream incises its channel

alluvial fan
    large, fan or cone shaped deposit of stream sediment
    when a high gradient stream leaves a narrow vallet and enters a flat plain or valley floor
    often happends in flash flooding environments
    size of sediments decreases with distance from mouth
    10-15 degree angle of slope

deltas
    form when a stream enters standing water
        current slows and loses its competence
            sediment drops out
    stream divides into a fan of small distributaries
    shape due to interplay of flow, waves, and tides
    lobes
        river periodically switches course via avulsion
            river breakes through a levee upstream
            establishes a shorter, steeper path
        abandoned delta lobes are sediment starved
            sediments deposited before avulsion slowly subside
                compaction, dewatering and decay of organic matter
            eventually submerged

contamination
    polluted runoff
        water runs over land and picks up contaminants
            bacteria
            oil
            pesticides
            animal feces
            dirt
    anoxic zones
        dead zones lacking oxygen
