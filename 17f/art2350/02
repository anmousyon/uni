        1200 x 800
    dpi
        density of pixels per inch
    greyscale smaller than color
        rgb is 3 times the size
    A4 = 24
    image interpolation

camera parts
    lens
        aperture
            hole that lets the light in
            fstop
                higher number
                    smaller the opening and less light
                    long depth of field
                lower number
                    larger opening and more light
                    short depth of field
    body
        shutter speed
            how fast shutter closes
                measured in fractions of a second
                higher number
                    faster shutter
                    less light
                lower number
                    slower shutter
                    more light
            increase aperture, increase shutter speed too
            decrease aperture, decrease shutter speed too
            going below 1/60
                use tripod
    "film"
        iso
            sensitivity of cells (how fast film is)
            higher
                more noise (grainy film)
            lower
                less noise (fine grain)
