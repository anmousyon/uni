resource limits
    cannot search to leaves
    depth limited search
        instead, search a limited depth of tree
        replace terminal utilities
            with heuristic eval function for non-terminal positions
    guarantee of optimal play is gone
        optimal isnt always needed

heurstic evaluation function
    function which scores non-terminals
    ideal function
        returns the utility of the position
    in practice
        typically weighted sum of features
        ie num of white queens - num of black queens

iterative deepening
    dfs which only searchs for paths of 1
    then 2
    then 3
    etc

stochastic single-player
    expectimax search
        chance nodes
            like actions except env controls actions chosen
        max nodes as before
        chance nodes take average (expectation) of value of children
        this is the optimistic approach
            minimax is the pessimistic approach

maximum expected utility
    an agent should chose the path that maximizes its expected utility

probability notes
    random var
        represents an event whose outcome is unknown
    probability distribution
        an assignment of weights to outcomes

frequentist
    averages over repeated experiments
    assertion about how future experiments will go
    makes one think of inherently random events

bayesian
    prior distribution (belief) with each outcome
    degrees of belief about unobserved variables
    often learn probs from past experiences
    new evidence updates beliefs

sources of uncertainty in random variables
    inherently random processes
    insufficient or weak evidence
    ignorance of underlying processes
    unmodeled variables
        known unknowns
        known knowns
        unkown unknowns
        unknown knowns
    world is noisy -> doesnt behave according to plan

expectimax search
    we have a prob model of how the opponent (or env) will behave in any state
        simple uniform distribution
            ie roll a die
        sophisticated and require a great deal of computation
        have a node for every outcome out of our control
            opponent or environment
        model might say that adversarial actions are likely
