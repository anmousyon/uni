#EXAMPLES#

1.

    a.

        delete all leaf nodes not x,y,z
        delete outgoing edges from y2
        graph still connected, not conditionally independent

    b.

        delete all leaf nodes not x,y,z
        delete all outgoing edges from xw
        not connected, is conditionally independent

    *c.

        draw bayesian network over P(x1,z1,x2,y2,z2,x3)
            given y1
        P(x1,z1,x2,y2,z2,x3) = sum(P(all vars)|y1)
        P(y1|x1) and P(x2|y1,z1)
        sum{y1}(f(x1,y1,z1.x2)) = f(x1,z1,x2)
        P(x1) P(z1|x1) P(x2|z1,x1)

2. -> variable elimination

    a.

        eliminate var
            multiply all functions that mention it
            sum out the variable
            add back to database

        P(x1=1|x2=0)
        eliminating x3
            sum{x3}(P(x3|y2,z2))
            = f(y2,z2)
        eliminating y2
            sum{y2}(P(y2|x2))
        eliminating z2
            sum{z2}(P(z2|x2))

        relevancy based reasoning

    b. -> best elimination ordering

        optimal if it never creates a function
            such that the scope of the function created is not included in the total scope

        ie it never creates a large function

    c. _. time and space complexity

        finding degree of var
            number of variables that form functions with it

        ie for y2
            x2, x3, z2
            p(y2|x2)
            p(x3|y2,z2)

4.
    a.
    
        laplace smoothing
            pretend like we see each example at least once
            laplace-k smoothing -> see them at least k times
                tuned using validation data

    b.

        classification

5.

    a.
        
        perceptron classification
        separability
    
    b.

        error and separability
