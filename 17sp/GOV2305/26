            P -> pivotality
                p = (1/v)
            B -> benefits
                b = security + tax costs + healthcare + jobs + equal opportunity
            C -> costs
                c = time, travel, stress, knowledge
            D -> civic duty
                d = enjoyment of norms, satisfaction of development, sense of duty to vote
