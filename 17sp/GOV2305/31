                win seats based on proportion of vote you win
                party lists
                    voting for party instead of people
        district magnitude -> how many seats are available to be won
            single member district (smd)
                one seat is available
            multi member district (mmd)
                more than one seat available

                end up with two parties
            median voter theory
                when you have two parties, each party dominates opposite sides of ideological spectrum
                both compete for single median voter
                    person in the middle of the ideological spectrum
                for primaries, try to capture madian voter of party instead of general
