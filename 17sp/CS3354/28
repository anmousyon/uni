testing and walkthrough
    remove roughly 30% of defects


inspections
    remove 60-90% of defects
        60% for newly trained team
        90% for experienced teams
    highest return inspections are of requirements and design

elements of inspections
    steps
        planning
        overview
        perp
        meeting
        rework
        follow-up
    roles
        moderator
        recorder
        reader
            active listening
        producer
fagan's rules for inspections
    optimum number of inspectors is four
    review rate should be
        ~140 lor/hr for design docs
            no more than 280 lot/hr
        ~125 sloc/hr for code
            no more than 250 sloc/hr
    inspection meetings should not last more than two hours
    no more than two inspection meetings per day
    key props
        formal moderator training
        defined participant roles
        moderator "drives" the inspection
        use of "how to find errors" checklists
        use distribution of error types to look for
        follow-up to reduce bad fixes
        less future errors becuase of detailed error feedback to the individual programmer

evidence-based inspections
    preconditions
        clear and visible management support
        defined policy
        good training for all
        effective procedures
        proper planning
        adequate resources

team size
    fagan
        four is a good size
    buck
        little difference between 3, 4, and 5
    freedman and weinberg
        select reviewers to ensure that the material is adequately covered
    porter and votta
        inspections with two reviewers were no less effective than those with four

pareto rule
    80/20 rule
        80% of the defects are in 20% of the modules
    OS/370
        47% of defects found in 4% of the modules

systemic defects
    casual analysis at end of ...

lessons
    inspect before unit test
    good inspection results can create false confidence
    inspections can improve the quality of maintenance fixes
    inspections can replace unit test with significant cost savings
    no matter how well they are executed, inspections cannot overcome serious flaws in dev process

barriers
    belief they are too expensive
        four engineers per review
        150 sloc/hr for code reviews
        max of 2 hours per review
        max of 2 reviews per day for an engineer
    schedule pressure leaves no time for reviews
    hostile reviews
        poor interpersonal skills
        poor facilitation
    use of review results for performance evaluations

# formal methods #
##################

technique for expressing reqs in a manner that allows the reqs to be studied mathematically

levels
    0
        formal spec may be undertaken and then a program dev from this informally
    1
        formal dev and formal verification may be used to produce a program in a more formal manner
            proofs of props or refinements from the spec to a program may be undertaken
            may be most appropriate in high-integrity systems involving safety or security
    2
        theorem provers may be used to undertake fully formal machine-checked proofs
