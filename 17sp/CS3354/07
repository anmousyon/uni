entity-relationship modeling
    understanding the data
    putting it in a format for reltionship modeling
    semi-formal technique
        widely used for specifying databases
    doesnt deal well with many-to-many reltionships

many-to-many
    join tables

more complex
    joining multiple tables
    i (item) is supplied by c (company) for use in p (project)

finite state machines (restricted turing machine)
    abstract representation of behavior exhibited by some systems
    dervied from app requirements
        network protocol could be modeled using an FSM
    not all aspects of requirements can be modelled with an fsm
        eg. timing
    state
        description of a status of a system at a specific point in time
    transition
        set of actions to execute when a condition is true or event is recieved
    completely specified
        every state has every input mapped to an action

extended fsm
    fsm tansition rules
        current state and event -> next state

fsm tradeoffs
    advantages
        easy to write
        easy to validate
        easy to convert into code
        more precise than graphical models
        almost as easy to understand
    disadvantages
        timing not handled

requirements or design?
    fsm could serve
        as a specification for required behavior
        design artifact according to which an application is to be implemented

uml state machines
    introduce the concepts of hierarchically nested states and orthogonal regions
        while extending notion of actions
    combo of mealy and moore machines
        mealy
            triggering event

petri nets
    powerful technique for specifying systems that have potential problems with interrelations
    consists of four parts
        P - set of places
        T - set of transitions
        I - input function
        O - output function

@NEED TO KNOW
classical analysis methods
    formal
        more powerful than either
        harder to understand then either
    semiformal
        easier to understand than formal
        more precise than informal
    informal
        not as powerful as either
        easier then either to understand
