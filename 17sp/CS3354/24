# when to use agile #
#####################

requirements change
    1-2% -> plan-driven
    30-40% -> agile

culture
    order -> plan-driven
    chaos -> agile

team size
    large -> plan-driven
    small -> agile

criticality
    life-critical -> plan-driven
    comfort -> agile

personnel (experience level)
    less experienced developers -> plan-driven
    more experienced developers-> agile

key questions
    are we measuring the right thing?
        goal / question / metric (GQM)
        business objectived <-> data
            cost ($, effort)
            schedule (duration, effort)
            functionality (size)
            quality (defects)
    are we measuring it right?
        operational definitions
        is the measurement and its result repeatable?

practical measurement
    if the information is not needed, the measurement is useless

goal-driven measurement
    goal / question /metric (GQM)
        * see above *
    SEI variant: goal-driven measurement
        goal / duestion / indicator / metric (GQIM)
    ISO 15939 and PSM variant: measurement information model

operational measures
    operational definition
        one which resonable people can agree on and do business with
        rules and procedures used to capture and record data
        meet two citeria
            communication
                will others know what has been measures and why?
            repeatability
                would other be able to repeat the measurements and get the same results?
        examples
            loc
                new, modified, deleted, retained function, comments
            time units
                hours vs minutes
            how is a defect defined?
                severity, criticality, impact
            is the data collected at the same point in the process each time?
                peer review before or after compile / unit test

putnam and myers measurements
    size
        how much has been built?
        how much needs to be built?
    prdouctivity
    time
        how long have we been working on it?
        how much longer do we neeed?
    effort
        how many man hours has been put it?
        how many more man hours do we need?
    reliability
        how many defects are in it?
        how many defects do we need to fix in the end?

SEI core measurements
    checklisy-based approach with strong emphasis on operational defs
    measurements
        size
            sloc
        effort
            person hours
        schedule
        quality
            defects
