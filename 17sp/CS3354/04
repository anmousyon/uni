the iron triangle
    three things
        scope
        cost
        schedule
    changing one affects one or both of the others
    you cannot "set" all three at the same time

        schedule
        staff
        cost
        quality
        scope

software design principles
    divide and conquer
        aka stepwise refinement, reductionism
    modules
        small enough to understand
    high cohesion
        focused on one thing
    low coupling
        minimize interconnections
    information hiding
        abstraction

critical software practices
    project integrity
    construction integrity
    product stability and integrity

unified process
    iterative and incremental design
    phases
        inception
        elaboration
        construction
        transition
    workflows
        requirements
        analysis
        design
        implementation
        test
