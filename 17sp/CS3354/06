    4 major defects in each page of requirements

requirements
    complete
        include descriptions of all facilities required
    consistent
        no conflicts or contradictions in description of system facilities

requirements jargon
    shall
        requirements are mandatory binding provisions
    will
        statement of fact, non-binding provisions
    should
        preferences, non-binding provisions
    may
        non-mandatory
    avoid negative requirements (shall not)
    use active voice

srs outline (boilerplate)
    in chapter 3

most popular way of writing requirements
    use cases
        scenarios
        steps for how things are to be done

process activities
    discovery
        interact with stakeholders tp discover requirements
        discover domain requirements at this stage
    classification and organization
        group related requirements and organize them into coherent clusters
    prioritization and negotiation
        prioritize requirements and resolve requirements conflicts
    specification
        document requirements and input into the next round of the spiral

UP requirements workflow
    what must the product do?
    develop understanding of application domain
    build business model of clients bisiness process

requirements management (sommerville)
    identification
    change management process
    traceability policies
        define relationships between each requirement
            and between requirements and system design that should be recorded
    tool support
        range from specialist management systems to spreadsheets and databases

percentage of change on software projects of varying size
    on avg, 45% of features in waterfall are never used
        19% are rarely used
    early waterfall schedules and estimates vary up to 400% from final actuals

customer relationships in agile
    capture requirements in user stories rather than requirements specification
        emphasize conversation
        user story = card + conversation + confirmation

# requirements analysis #
#########################

analysis
    focus on INVESTIGATION of problem

design
    focus on CONCEPTUAL solution to problem

UP analysis workflow
    analyze and refine the requirements to achieve detailed understanding
    requirements uses language of the client
    analysis workflow uses a more precise language

system perspectives
    external
        model context or environment of system
    interaction
        model interactions between system and environment
            or between components
    structural
        model organization of system
            or structure of data that is processed by system
    behavioral
        model dynamic behavior of system and how it responds to events

graphical models (uml)
    facilitates discussion about existing or proposed system
        incomeplete or incorrect models are ok if they help support discussion
    documenting an existing system
        accurate but not necessarilly complete
    detailed system to generate system implementation
        both correct and complete

formal vs informal
    informal enough for client
        client is generally not a specialist
    formal enough for developers
        primary source of info for drawing up the design
    these two requirements are mutually contradictoruy
    informal
        written in a natural language

solution strategy
    general approach to building the product
    find strategies without worrying about constraints
        modifying strategies in light of constraints, if necessary
    keep written record of all discarded strategies (and reason for discarding)
        protect the analysis team
        prevent unwise new "solutions" during postdelivery maintenance
