safely estimating
    be pessimistic in estimates
    each level in the management hierarchy should add their own safety factor
    protect your estimates froma global cut

wating the safety
    student syndrome
    multi-tasking
    dependency reliance

planning fallacy
    unrealistically close to best-case scenarios
    could be improved by consulting the statistics of similar cases

suspect plans
    straight lines
        usually indicative of not enough thought put into it
    step function
        work breakdown may not be granular enough for effective tracking
    the cliff
        more of a prayer than a plan

CCPM: multi-tasking
    biggest killer of lead time (throughput)

risk management
    risk
        an undertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a + or - effect on a project's objectives
    risk exposure
        prob of bad outcome * loss from bad outcome
        RE = P(BO) * L(BO)

risk response planning
    avoid
        change the plan to eliminate the risk or protect from its impact
    transfer
        shift the consequence of a risk to a thrid part along with ownership of the response
    mitigate
        reduce the prob and/or consequences of an adverse risk event to an acceptable threshold
    acceptance
        it is seldom possible to eliminate all risk
    contingent response strategy
        executed under predefined conditions

top ten software risk items
    personnel shortfalls
    unrealistic scheules and budgets
    developing the wrong functions and properties
    developing the wrong user interface
    gold-plating
    continuing stream of requirements changes
    shortfalls in externally furnished components
    shortfalls in externally performed tasks
    real-time performance shortfalls
    straining computer science capabilities

earned value management
    define the work
    schedule the budget
    measure the performance
    relates three independent variables
        planned value (PV)
            estimated cost planned for a activity during a given period
        actual cost (AC)
            costs incurred in accomplishing work on an activity during the given period
        earned value (EV)
            value of the work completed
        scheduled variance (SV)
            how much you spend versus how much you planned
        cost variance (CV)
            how much you spend versus how much you allocated
