            atoms, numbers, vars, or compound terms
                atom
                    general-purpose game with no iherent meaning

                    eg. X
                compound terms
                    composed of an atom called a "functor" and number of arguments which are terms
                    functor followed by comma-sep list of argument terms, which is contaied in ()
                    list
                        ordered collection of terms
                        eg. [1,2,3]
                    strings
                        sequence of chars
    syntax
        rule
            Head :- Body.
                head is true if body is true
        clauses
            cat(tom).
                tom is a cat
            cat(tom) :- true.
                tom is always a cat
        questions
            ?- cat(tom).
                true
            ?- cat(X).
                X=tom
        clause with body = rule
            animal(X) :- cat(X)
                ?- animal(X).
                    X=tom
