syntax
    form or structure of the expressions, statements, and program units

semantics
    meaning of the expressions, statements and program units

sentence
    string of chars ocer some alpha

language
    set of sentences

lexeme
    lowest level syntactic unit (*, sum, begin)

token
    category of lexemes
    eg. toekn

recognizers
    reads input strings over alpha
    decides whether input belongs to lang

generators

grammar
    sigma, N, P, S
    4 parts
        sigma - alpha
        N - set of nonterminal symbols
        P - production of rules
        S - starting symbol

contezt-free grammars
    dev by noam chomsky
    language generators
        mean to describe syntax of natural languages
    BNF is equivalent to context-free grammars

BNF
    abstractions used to represent classes of syntactic tructures
        act like syntactic vars (also called nonterminal symbols)
    terminals are lxemes
    nonterminals
        often enclosed in angle brackets
            <ident_list)> -> indentifier | identifier, <ident_list>
            <if_stmt> -> if <logic_expr> then <stmt>
    grammar
        finite non-empty set of rules
    start symbol
        special element of the nonterminals of a grammar

an abstraction (or nonterminal symbol) can have more than one rhs
    <stmt> -> <single_stmt> | begin <stmt_list> end
        is same as
            <stmt> -> <single_stmt>
            <stmt> -> <begin <stmt_list> end

describing lists
    syntactic lists are described using recursion
        <ident_list> -> ident | ident, <ident_list>
    
ambigious
    generates a sentential form with at least two different parse trees

semantics
    operational
    denotational
    axiomatic
