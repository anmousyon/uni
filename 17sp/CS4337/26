abstraction
    view or rep of an entity that includes only the most significant attributes

abstract data type
    rep of objects  ot the type is hidden from the program units that use these objects
        only the ops possible tare those provided in types def
    syntactic unit
    adv of hidden
        reliability
        security
        name conflicts less likely
    adv of unit
        organization modifiability
        separate compilation
    lang reqs
        syntactic unit in which to encapsulate type def
    design issues
        form of container for interface to the type?
        can they be parameterized?
        what access controls are provided?
        is specification separate from implementation?

parameterized adt
    allow designing an adt that can store any type elements
        only an issue for statically styped laguages
    aka generic classes

encapsulation
    files containing one or more subprograms can be independently compiled
    classes
        class is used as the interface
        implementation is separate from declaration/definition
    accessing public/private members of class
