rules and constraints
    program P: a set of rules
    herbrand universe
        set of ground terms constructed from function symbols and constants occurring in the program P
        HU(P)
    herbrand base
        set of ground atoms constructed from predicate symbols and ground terms from the herbrand universe
        HB(P)
    rule with vars
        shorthand for the collection of its collection of its ground instances
    program with variables
        collection of ground instances of its rules
    translate program (with vars) to ground program (without vars)
    to ground program
        enumerate each predicate with var by subbing each var with each constant in HU to get HB

herbrand universe becomes infinite with a function
    function can call itself
    0, f(0), f(f(0), ...

stable models
    a set of x factsc(ground atoms) is a model of a logic program P 
        if head(r)  elementOF X whenever body(r)+ elementOF X and
        body(r) intsectedwith X = emptySet
    gelfond-lifshitz reduct (gl-reduct)
        removing rules with "not c" in the body for each c elementOf C
        removing literals "not c" from all other rules for each c not elementOf x
