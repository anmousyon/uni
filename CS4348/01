expectations
    performance
    reliability
        good uptime
    security
        boundaries between users, their assets, and their resources
        limiting access for users to the system
    fairness
        proportional allocation of uses
    efficiency
        using resources in best possible way
    ease of use
        no unnessecaryy complications
    responsiveness
        expect system to be able to work at any time

os
    resource allocator
        manages all resources
        mediates conflicting resource allocation requests
    control program
        controls execution of programs to prevent errors and improper use

*response time
  time of submission to time of completion

allowing shorter tasks to always go first can starve longer tasks

kernel
    program that is running at all times
    everything else is a system program or applications program

dual-mode
    allows os to protect itself
    user mode and kernel mode
    mode bit
        distinguish between when system is running user or kernel code
        privileged
            only executable in kernel mode
        system call changes to kernel then, on return, resets to user
    multi-mode
        vmm
            virtual machine manager for guest VMs

user process executing (user) ->
calls system call (user) ->
execute system call (kernel) ->
return from system call (user)

main memory
    random access -> ram
        accessing x+1 takes same time as x+y where y is arb
        offset does not affect access time
    typically volatile

hdd
    sequential access
        access time is proportional to offset
    nonvolatile
    surface is divided into disks
        subdivided into sectors
    disk controller
        determines logical interaction between device and computer

sdd
    faster than hdd
    nonvolatile
    sequential access

row-major form
    fill first row completely then go to next

core dump
    dumps contents of memory to file for debugging

locality of preference
    spatial
        memory around used memory
    temporal
        memory used recently

applications intensities
    compute intensive
        many arithmetic ops
        constantly needs cpu
    io intensive
        many reads/writes to storage
        cpu sits idle during io
