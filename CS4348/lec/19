SCAN
    like an elevator

SSTF
    go to closest request

C-SCAN
    more uniform wait time than SCAN
    goes from one end to the other like SCAN
        but goes back to start without servicing once it reaches the end
        instead of going backward and servicing requests on return
    treats cylinders as a circular list
        that wraps around from the last cylinder to the first one

mean service time
    higher with SCAN than C-SCAN because of backward pass

variance
    high variance is bad
    scheduling becomes unpredictable

C-LOOK
    arm only goes as far as last request
    goes back to first request instead of start of disk

raid
    redundant array of inexpensive disks
    reliability via redundancy
    increases mean time to failure
    increases speed
    mean time to repair
        exposure time when another failure could cause data loss
    mean time to data loss
        based on above factors
    frequently combined NVRAM to improve performance

reliability -> redundancy
speed & performance -> striping

raid levels
    raid 0
        non-redundant striping
    raid 1
        mirrored disks
        need n more disks
    raid 2
        memory-style error-correcting codes
        need log(n) more disks
    raid 3
        bit-interleaved parity
    raid 4
        block-interleaved parity
    raid 5
        block-interleaved distributed parity
    raid 6
        P+Q redundancy

raid 2
    uses checksums to detect errors
    can detect faults (almost always) but cant always correct faults

    0 bit error
        no error
    1 bit error
        can detect, can correct
    2 bit error
        can detect, cant always correct
    3 bit error
        cant detect, cant correct

    hamming distance
        distance in bits
        1 less than that is how many you can reliably correct for

    cant detect which bit in the row or column is wrong by themselves
        if only one error in row and column
            by combining them together you can detect which bit is wrong

raid 3
