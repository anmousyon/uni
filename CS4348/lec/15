compile time
    if memory location known a priori
        absolute code can be generated
        must recompile cose if starting location changes

load time
    must gen relocatable code if memory location isnt known at compile time

execution time
    binding delayed until run time if process can be moved during execution

variable partitions
    variables sizes for efficiency

hole
    block of available memory
    holes of various sizes are scattered throughout memory

memory compaction
    moving things around to combine the space from the holes

first fit
    allocate the first hole that is big enough

best fit
    allocate the smallest hole that is big enough
    must search entire list, unless ordered by size
    produces smallest leftover hole

worst fit
    allocate the largest hole
    must also search entire list
    produces largest leftover hole

external fragmentation
    total memory space exists to satisfy a request but not contiguous

internal fragmentation
    allocated memory may be slightly larger than requested memory
    this size diff is memory internal to a partition, but not being used

first fit analysis
    given N block allocated, 0.5N lost to fragmentation
    1/3 may be unusable -> 50% rule

page table
    transaltes logical to physical address

page number (p)
    used as an index into a page table
    which contains base address of each page in physical memory

page offset (d)
    combined with base address
    to define memory address that is sent to the memory unit
