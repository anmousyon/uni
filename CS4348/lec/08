starvation -> indefinite blocking
    process may never be removed from sem queue where it is suspended

priority inversion
    lower priority process holds a lock needed by higher priority
    solved via priority-inheritance protocol

bounded buffer problem
    n buffers, each can hold one item
    semaphore mutex <- 1
    semaphore full <- 0
    semaphore empty <- n

producer -> wait on full
    do{
        next_produced = produce()
        wait(empty) //wait until there is space to place in the buffer
        wait(mutex)
        buffer.append(next_produced)
        signal(mutex)
        signal(full) //increments amount of objects in buffer
    }while(true)

consumer -> wait on empty
    do{
        wait(full) //wait until there is at least one itme in the buffer
        wait(mutex)
        next_consumed = buffer.remove()
        signal(mutex)
        signal(empty) //decrements the amount of items in the buffer
        consume(next_consumed)
    }while(true)

readers-writers problem
    dataset is shared among a numberof concurrent processes
        readers
            only read the data set
            do not perform any updates
        writiers
            can both read and write
    problem ->allow multiple readers to read at the same time
        only one single writer can access the shared data at the same time
    several variations of how readers and writers are considered
        all involve some form of priorities
    shared data
        data set
        semaphore rw_mutex <- 1
        semaphore mutex <- 1
        integer read_count <- 0

read-write conflict
    cant have someone write while someone else is reading

write-write conflict
    cant have someone write while someone else is writing

dining-philosophers problem
    there are multiple philosophers
    alternate between thinking and eating
    dont interact with their neighbors
    5 chopsticks
    5 philosophers
    to eat
        pick up chopsticks (one at a time) to eat from a bowl
        need both
        release both when done
    shared data
        dataset (food)
        semaphore (chopstick)

basic concepts
    max spu util obtained with multiporgramming
    cpu-i/o burst cycle
        process exec consists of a cycle of cpu exec and i/o wait
    cpu burst followed by i/o burst
    cpu burst distribution is of main concern

cpu util
    keep the cpu busy

throughput
    # of processes hat complete their exec per time unit

tunraround time
    amount of time to exec a particular process
