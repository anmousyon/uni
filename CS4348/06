implicit threading
	creation and management done by compilers and run-time libs
	three methods
		thread pools
		openMP
		grand central dispatch

thread pools
	create a # of threads in a poll where they await work
	pros
		faster to service request of existing thread than creating new one
		allows # of threads in an app to be bound by size of pool
		separating task to be performed from mechanics of creating task
			and running task

OpenMP
	parallelizes regions of code
	provides support for parallel programming in shared-mem env

producer-consumer problem
	producer enqueues
	consumer dequeues
	in & out pointers
		used to find the two ends of the circular queue
		full and empty look the same
	problem using counter
		code for counter ++/-- can get interwoven
		value for counter becomes incorrect
			either 1 more or 1 less

race condition
	two sets of code trying to read and wrtie to some data
	can read wrong different data based on order of code execution

ciritical section problem
	each process has a critical section segment
		process may be changing common vars
		while one process in critical section
			no other process may be
	each process asks permission to enter critical section in entry section
	may follow critical section with exit section
	then remainder section

solution to critical section problem
	mutual exclusion
		if process Pi is executing in its critical section
			no other process can be in its critical section
	progress
		if no process is executing in its critical section
		and there is a process that wish to enter their critical section
			then the selection of the processes that will enter
			cannot be postponed indefinitely
	bounded waiting
		bound must exist on the # of time that other processes
		can access critical section

handling of critical section in OS
	preemptive
		allows preemption of process when running in kernel mode
			prone to race conditions
	non-preemptive
		runs until exits kernel mode, blocks or yields CPU
			essentially free of race conditions in kernel mode
			places constraints on scheduling
