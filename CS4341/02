modules
    combinational
        assign
        case or casex (with default)
        if -> only if all signals have default
        instantiations of other comb modules
    sequential
        combinational logic
        explicitly declared registers (flip flops)

dont use
    loops
    always except for case, casex, or if statements

do use
    signal concatenations
        {a,b} = {c,d}
    signal subranges
        a[7:1]

constants
    width defined as 5'd31 not 31

signals
    buses are numbered high to low
        wire [31:0] bus
    all signals should be high-true (except primary inputs and outputs)
