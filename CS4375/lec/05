point estimation
    sampling a population and trying to guess the parameters

random variables
    denotes domething about which we are uncertain
    ie
        A = True if randomly drawn person is female
        A = The hometown of a randomly drawn person from our class
    function defined over the sample space

sample space
    set of possible worlds (instances)

event
    subset of the sample space

conditional probability
    P(A|B) = (P(A&B)/P(B))

bayes rule
    P(A|B) = [(P(B|A)*P(A))/P(B)]
    P(A) -> prior
    P(A|B) -> posterior
    P(B|A) -> likelihood
