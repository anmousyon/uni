alg behaviour
    running time
    mem/storage requirement
    bandwidth/power/logic gates/etc

cases
    best
    worst
    average

    best and worst
        O(n^2)

insertion
    worst
        O(n^2)
    best
        O(n)

        O(n)

quicksort
    best and average
        O(nlog(n))
    worst
        O(n^2)

heapsort
    best and worst

tight boundary
    best = worst

quicksort
    pick number
    anything smaller goes to left
    anything larger goes to right
    repeat on left side
    repeat on right side
    will now be sorted
