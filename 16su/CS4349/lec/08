principle of optimality
    every optimal solution to a problem contains
        optimalsolutions to all subproblems
    if you have optimal solution to all subproblems
        cant necessarily combine them for optimal solution

tree
    empty tree
        no nodes
    branching factor of a node
        number of children it has
    file systems usually implements as a tree

depth-first
    explores a path all the way to leaf
    then backtracks and explores another path
    search(node):
        if node is goal
            print node
            return success
        for child in node:
            if search(c)
                print child
                return success
        return failure

breadth-first
    explores nodes nearest the root before going deeper
    searches similarly to way priority queue fills

heuristics
    best guess for result
    uses built-in knowledge and probability for decision making
    more you know, the better it will do

pbv -> preliminary backed-up value
    explore down to a given value using dfs
