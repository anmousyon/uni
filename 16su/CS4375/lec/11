bayes network
    all about belief
    gives conditional independence
        between items on same level
    burglary -> alarm
        implied alarm depends on burglary
    without network
        for 5 items, need 32 (2^5) instances
        actually need 31 (32-1) because sum of all is known (1)
        (2^5 - 1) needed instances
            can figure out last one from all the others
    we've made a local markov assumption
        not always true
    given a parent
        two children are independent from each others

d-separation (dependency separation)
    if x1, x2, x3 are three disjoint subsets of nodes in a dag
        then x2 is said to d-separate x1 and x2
            if every undirected path from x1 and x3 are blocked by x2
    direct connection x->y
    indirect
        x->y->z
    serial connection
        a->b->c
        evidence about b blocks
        no evidence about b allows
    diverging
        z->x and z->y
        evidence about z will block
        no evidence about z will allow
    converging connection
        a->b->c and d->b->c
        comment effect
        evidence about b or its children will allow
        no evidence about b or its children will block
    multiple paths
        ALL paths must be blocked to stop flow

hidden markov models
    markov assumption (mth order)
        each node depens on the previous m nodes
    1st order -> O(k^2)
    mth order -> O(k^(m+1))
    n-1th order -> O(k^n)
    distributions that characterize sequential data with few parameters
        but are not limited by strong markov assumptions
    example problems
        how likely is a sequence, given models?
            evaluation
        what portion of the sequence was gen by fair die, by loaded die?
            decoding
        how loaded/fair is the die and how often does it switch?
            learning
            find params given hmm and sequence
    forward alg
        prob of sequence
    forward-backward alg
        prob third roll was loaded

reinforcement learning
    give a reward for making the right move
    given a state, what is the best action to take to maximize rewards
    horizon problem
        need a time limit
    discounted rewards
        reward in future is not worth quite as much as a reward now
