expectimax pruning?
    extremely hard
        exact: need bounds on possible values
        approximate: sample high-probability branches
    sampliing alg
        helps you go deeper

expectimax evaluation
    quickly return an estimate for a node's true value
    for minimax, evaluation function scale doesnt matter
        we just want better states to have higher evaluations
            --get ordering right--
        called insensitivity to monotonic transformations
            monotonic function -> changes values while preserving order
    for expectimax, we need magnitudes to be meaningful
        NOT insensitive to monotonic transformations

mixed layer types
    expectiminimax
        2 player game with chance
        as depth increases, prob of reaching a given node shrinks
        at max
            same
        at min
            same
        at chance
            computed expected values of children
        pruning is VERY hard

multi-player non-zero-sum games
    similar to minimax
        utilities are now tuples
        each player maximizes their own entry at each node
        propogate (or back up) nodes from children
        can give rise to cooperation and competition dynamically

knowledge base
    set of sentences in a formal language
    delcarative approach to building an agent (or other system)
        tell it what it needs to know
        then it can ask itself what todo
            answers should follow from the kb
    agents can be viewed at the knowledge level
        ie: what they know, regardless of how implemented
    or at the implementation level
        data structures in KB and algs that manipulate them

knowledge ->[learning]-> computer model <-[inference]-> question/answer

knowledge representation and reasoning
    important problems
        representation
            represent knowledge in a formal language
        inference
            answer a query posed over the model
        learning
            induce a model in a particular formal language that best fits data

entailment
    one thing follows from another
