prob models
    bayesian networks
    independence in BNs
    networks for rep high-dimensional prob dist in a compact manner

## BAYES NET ##

two probs with using full joint dist tables as prob models
    unless few vars, joint dist is WAY too big
    hard to learn (estimate) anything about more than a few vars at a time

technique for describing complex joint dist using simple, local dist
    more properly called graphical models

displays how vars are related to each other

semantics
    set of nodes, one per var X
    it is a dag
    conditional dist for each node
        collection of dists over X, one for each comb of parents vals
        P(X|a[1],...,a[n]) where a[i] is a parent of X
    CPT
        conditional prob table

topology (graph) + local conditional probs

implicitly encode joint dists
    product of local conditional dists
    prob BN gives to full assignment, mult all relevant conditionals together
        P(x[1],...x[2]) = product(i=1 to n)P(x[i]|parents(X[i]))

fully connected -> bad idea
    d is number of parents
    P(X) -> O(d)
    P(Y|X) -> O(d^2)
    grows exponentially

extra arcs dont prevent rep independence
    just allow non-independence

independence
    are two nodes independent given certain evidence?
        d-sep (dependency separation)
    if x1, x2, x3 are three disjoint subsets of nodes in a dag
        then x2 is said to d-separate x1 and x2
            if every undirected path from x1 and x3 are blocked by x2
    direct connection x->y
    indirect
        x->y->z
    serial connection
        a->b->c
        evidence about b blocks
        no evidence about b allows
    diverging
        z->x and z->y
        evidence about z will block
        no evidence about z will allow
    converging connection
        a->b->c and d->b->c
        comment effect
        evidence about b or its children will allow
        no evidence about b or its children will block
    multiple paths
        ALL paths must be blocked to stop flow
    d-sep(x,y,z) only if x is cond independent of y given z
